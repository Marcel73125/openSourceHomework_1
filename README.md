# openSourceHomework_1
This is the first homework submission for the lecture Open Source Energy Modelling

## Calculation tool for capacity factor and fullloadhours

This code calculates the capacity factor and fulloadhours of a powerplant. 
The required parameters in the main function are:
  yearly energy yield of the plant in kWh
  nominal (or peak) power of the plant kW
The it is not neccesarily required to use the unit kilowatts, but the units of energy yield an power have to have the same dimesion.

The functions calc_capacity_factor(energy, power) and calc_fullloadhours(energy, power) calculate the results and return the value.
